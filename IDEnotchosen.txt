In terms of choosing an IDE for this course, I do have prior experience working with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from previous courses and projects. However, despite its popularity and versatility, I did not choose VSCode for this course. Since this course is heavily focused on Java development, I looked into IDEs designed specifically for Java. Although VSCode supports various programming languages, it lacks the specialized features and optimizations of other Java-focused integrated development environments. Additionally, Java-specific IDEs excel at both sophisticated code analysis and reliable debugging, both of which VSCode lacks. Considering both my experience with VSCode and the course's Java focus, I selected a different IDE that I believe to be better suited to the coursework.
